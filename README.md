# Analyse-Yelp-Reviews
This project is to analyze Yelp's reviews and business dataset from Kaggle. I created a Spark Cluster on AWS EMR for loading data and running analysis.

The first step I create a cluster and a notebook, on AWS EMR and a bucket on AWS S3. I download the Yelp data from Kaggle then uploaded it to my bucket. I open jupyter notebook from the notebook of AWS EMR. Then I write code in the analysis.ipynb to do some analysis of the Yelp data.
